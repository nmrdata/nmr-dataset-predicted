It is designed to show the students that, thanks to NMR spectrometry, it is possible to determine the chemical structure.
To achieve this goal, the exercises are created based on structural isomers for a specific molecular formula.

Because the predictor currently does not accurately predict labile protons, these exercises do not contain OH or NH.

Second-order effects are correctly evaluated.
