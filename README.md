It is designed to show students that, thanks to NMR spectrometry, it is possible to determine the chemical structure of an unknown product. To achieve this goal, the exercises are created based on structural isomers for a specific molecular formula. However, as we can see, it quickly becomes challenging and students need to analyze the multiplicity of each signal in order to discover the chemical structure.

Because the predictor currently does not accurately predict labile protons, these exercises do not contain OH or NH.

Second-order effects are correctly evaluated so that you can have some information, based on the roof-effect, about some couplings.
